# ðŸŒ¤ Weather App

A clean and simple Weather App that shows current weather for any city.

- Unit toggle: **Â°C / Â°F**
- Demo Mode (works without API key) â€” great for GitHub Pages demo
- Saves last searched city to `localStorage`
- Responsive UI, easy to customize

## ðŸ§© How to Use (Demo)
1. Open `index.html` locally OR upload to GitHub Pages.  
2. By default **Demo Mode** is enabled â€” type a city name and click **Check**.  
3. To use live data, obtain an OpenWeatherMap API key (see below), paste it into `app.js` at the top (`API_KEY`), and uncheck **Demo Mode**.

## ðŸ”‘ Get an OpenWeatherMap API Key (optional, free)
1. Visit https://openweathermap.org/ and sign up.  
2. Go to API keys in your account, create a key.  
3. Replace the `API_KEY` value in `app.js` with your key.

**Important:** Do NOT commit secret keys in public repos in plaintext for production. For private work or demos, local replacement is OK. For production, use a serverless proxy to hide keys.
