# 🌤 Weather App

A clean and simple Weather App that shows current weather for any city.  
This project supports a **Demo Mode** so it works without an API key, and can be upgraded to use **OpenWeatherMap** for live data.

## 🧩 How to Use (Demo)  
1. By default **Demo Mode** is enabled — type a city name and click **Check**.  
2. To use live data, obtain an OpenWeatherMap API key (see below), paste it into `app.js` at the top (`API_KEY`), and uncheck **Demo Mode**.
